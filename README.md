# Space Invader

Space Invader is a classic arcade-style shooting game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a spaceship and aims to survive against waves of enemy spaceships while shooting them down. The game features multiple levels, increasing difficulty, and an engaging gameplay experience reminiscent of the retro arcade era.
